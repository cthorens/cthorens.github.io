# About
I am pursuing a doctorate in the [SECTRS](https://sectrs.ethz.ch/ "SECTRS") group at ETH Zürich. My research focus on Trusted Execution Environments and Confidential Computing.

Before starting my doctorate, I completed a Master’s degree in Computer Science at ETH Zürich. I also worked at Huawei as a research engineer, where my primary task was to integrate Confidential Computing into Ascend, the Huawei NPU.
