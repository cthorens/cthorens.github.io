# About
I am currently pursuing a doctorate in the [Secure & Trustworthy Systems Group](https://sectrs.ethz.ch/ "SECTRS") at ETH Zürich. My research focuses on Trusted Execution Environments and Confidential Computing.

Before starting my doctorate, I completed a Master’s degree in Computer Science at ETH Zürich. I also worked at Huawei as a research engineer, where my primary task was to integrate Confidential Computing into Ascend, the Huawei NPU.
